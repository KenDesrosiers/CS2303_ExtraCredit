In this project, we had to compare the speed between sorting using indexing and pointer incrementing for bubblesort.

the sample list i used had a size of 50,000. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the incrementing pointer sort to work properly,
but the first two work just fine. However, the incrementing pointers are supposed to be more time efficient.
